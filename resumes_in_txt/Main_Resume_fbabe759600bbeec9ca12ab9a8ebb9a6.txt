MACHINE LEARNING
PROJECTS (ALL AVAILABLE ON GITHUB) BOICE BLOCKCHAIN
- The project envisioned on modelling a blockchain which incorporates the security of Bitcoin blockchain and flexi- 
bility of Ethereum blockchain;
- Its an ongoing project of mine, in which I have already implemented core cryptography bits and pieces of code, 
including public-private key generation.
KEY VALUE PAIR EXTRACTOR FROM SCANNED DOCUMENTS
- The application was developed during a challenge organized by IIT-Bombay;
- The application can successfully extract tagged essential features from the scanned documents, which can be further 
used for analysis purposes;
- The application extracts text from .jpg or .pdf format documents by using Tessaract OCR.
DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
- The application significantly reduces time of execution of a process which consumes high amount of resources which is 
available;
- Application allows multiple-threading to increase the efficiency of the application, as it contains many asynchronous 
procedure calls.
MASKED-WEB-CRAWLER
- The application allows a user to crawl a web page without getting blocked by intelligent bot detector mechanisms 
implemented by various websites;
- To crawl dynamic websites, the main requirement is to execute the javascript on the web page, hence to solve this 
problem I used headless chrome;
- The application also takes care of not sending bulk of requests to the server, hence avoiding bot blocking.
CROWD FUNDING WEB
- The website was developed during a hackathon, which helps a fund-raiser to fund a particular organization which needs 
a specific target amount of funds;
- Interactive chat-bot was implemented with it to improve the user experience;
- Recommender system was implemented to recommend organisations to be funded to the fund-raisers, which he or she would 
be interested in on the basis of past preferences.

IMPORTANT ACHIEVEMENTS
